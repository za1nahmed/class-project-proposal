        <p>Feature List (prioritized list of features that can likely be delivered in the time allowed):This resume website project includes a responsive web page that follows the Lewis University resume format and presents structured content using HTML and CSS. A downloadable PDF version of the resume is linked directly on the page and is professionally formatted for printing. The site includes clean print formatting using CSS to remove unnecessary elements like page numbers when printed. All styling is handled through a separate CSS file for consistency and maintainability. The project is hosted on GitHub for version control and deployed on Azure, making it globally accessible via a secure HTTPS URL. Additional features include basic accessibility through semantic HTML and compatibility across modern web browsers.</p>

        <p>Basic Technical Features (list of technical features being implemented that demonstrates things you have learned in the class):This project demonstrates core technical concepts learned throughout the course, including the use of HTML to structure web content and CSS to style and format that content. Then a separate CSS file is linked to the HTML page, showing an understanding of external stylesheet usage. The resume content is organized using semantic HTML elements such as h1,p, and u1, supporting accessibility and clean code practices. Media queries are used to apply custom styles for printing using @media print. The site integrates a downloadable PDF resume, demonstrating how to link files for download. Additionally, the project is version-controlled using GitHub.</p>
